In the second part of the course of 3D Studio Max, you complete the knowledge of the most advanced tools available under the program and refine modeling techniques.

The 3D structures are more complex and you learn to change and optimize the models and also creating custom libraries, learning to make best use of textures and materials. At the end of the module the student will be able to build virtual sets complete and turn their AutoCAD projects into three-dimensional environments.
