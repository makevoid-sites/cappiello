Since 1956, the Leonetto Cappiello Academy of Art and Design has been the ideal  place to develop one’s creativity and turn it into a profession.  Even the most creative profession cannot be improvised. Professionality requires a solid foundation, concepts and techniques. Ideas are important, but not sufficient, and need to be shaped and applied in the best way possible.  

With over 50 years of experience in teaching, and thanks to a constant updating of its courses, the Cappiello Academy represents a specialized center for training tomorrow’s professionals in Graphics, Interior Design and Decorating, Advertising and Illustration.

Highly qualified teachers, who divide their time between professional work and teaching, bring their experience to the classroom and guarantee a  first-hand account work in their field.

An exclusive  conceptual  approach to projects stimulates thought and creativity and  teaches students to realize their ideas through  the most up-to-date  tools and software used by professionals.
