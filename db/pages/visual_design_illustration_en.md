The Illustration course is run by "*Prof. Roberto Innocenti*":http://www.robertoinnocenti.com/; who is considered one of the biggest international experts in Illustration.
The way he narrates by pictures and figures is masterful: like a Director he focuses on the most dynamic scenes and, depending on the story and its narrative time, he reinvents them.
He is one of the most famous italian illustrators and is considered as a true master in the field, including the United States where his books were first published.

He has won several awards: La Mela d'Oro, Gustav Heinemann's Peace Award, Drappo Rosso, Fiorino d'Oro and the renowned Andersen Award 2008, "the Nobel prize" of kids Illustration.

During the course the student will take part on practical workshops following the lead of famous illustrators. Moreover, they will experience different techniques and styles of illustration and will be led to discover his or her style of drawing; enabling them to learn a complex and fascinating craft.

The first part will be focused on the theory and the practice of image construction. The second part will be focused on analysing the practical technique.

Those who have attended the course fully will receive a certificate of attendance.
