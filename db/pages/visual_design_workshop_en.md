The Graphic Design workshop was set up to respond to the demands of those who do not have time to devote to an in-depth study of visual communication but nevertheless wish to get to know the basic mechanisms of digital graphics and design, getting to grips with the essential concepts.
The practical workshops organised during the course will help students to master the basic techniques for generating promotional information.
Students will be guided through the learning process so that, at the end of the course of lessons, they will be capable of organising documents of commercial information and self-advertising.
