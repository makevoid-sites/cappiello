The Interior Design Course is pointed to everyone who want to become a professional Interior Designer; a well skilled designer is able to divide spaces, advise customers the right material or finish depending on the purpose of use, suggest furniture and accessories for home furnishings, private rooms, offices and public places.
During two consecutive semesters the students learn the theoretical and practical basis of the profession. Many are the subjects of the course because many are the skills that an interior designer needs, beside his own perception and cultural buggage, in order to well interpretate people's taste and give them housing solutions combining aestethics and functionality.

Course Contents: Interior Design 1, Artistic Drawing, Geometric Drawing, Operational Design, Interior Design 2, History of Design, Digital representation, Design of living spaces, 3D Modelling , CAD, Presentation of project and Layout, History of Art.

Job opportunities will be advised to the students in the end of the course: every year, professional graphic studios and companies ask for young graduates offering a concrete opportunity of introduction in the working world.
