The short course in Visual Design  introduces the basics of visual communication through the realization of a graphics project.  Under the guidance of teachers, students are asked to address and resolve  all the difficulties  which emerge during  the various phases of a simulated job.  This full-immersion approach is aimed particularly  at those who work or study  full-time (students, recent graduates  or young professionals)   but also to anyone interested in this field who has a limited amount of free time.  In order to ensure  direct and personalized  teaching,  the class size is limited to 10.  This course is also  an introduction to the profession and preparatory to the annual course.
