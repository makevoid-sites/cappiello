Have you ever wanted to work with a 3D program easy and intuitive, you learn quickly? SketchUp is the answer. The software developed by Google, is developed with a particular focus on the conceptual stages of architectural planning and design and allows you to easily create 3D models. 
The Academy 'Cappiello' promotes a specific course to learn SketchUp , to give the possibility to all those who wish to upgrade to start designing in 3D in a short time. The master is open to all and includes two modules of 20 hours each. The basic module also allows those who uses a personal computer in a generic way (mail, internet, writing programs ..) to learn to move with ease between the controls and get good results quickly. Classes are held Monday and Thursday afternoons.
