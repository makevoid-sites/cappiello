AutoCAD is the program used primarily to produce two-dimensional and three-dimensional drawings for architectural and mechanical engineering as well.

The Academy offers a course divided into three modules that address the part of two-dimensional CAD design and is intended for all those who want to use AutoCAD for design and interior architecture.
