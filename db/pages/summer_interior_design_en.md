The short course in Interior Design is aimed  particularly at people who  work or study full-time (students, graduates,  young professionals)  but also at anyone interested in this field  who has a limited amount of  free time.   The course is conceived to provide a full-immersion overview of  Interior Design and help students focus on the most important aspects  of the professionas  they develop a project.  It serves as a starting point, as an opportunity for specialization or as a refresher course. To ensure direct and personalized  teaching,  the class is limited to 10 students.  This course also serves as an introduction to the profession and   is preparatory to the annual course.
