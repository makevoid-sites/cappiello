The *Annual Course in Digital Communication* is the latest addition to the Cappiello Academy, an answer to the ever-increasing formative and professional needs revolving around the world of communication and internet development.
The course addresses students who wish to combine horizontal competences regarding digital communication with further, vertical and extremely professionalizing, competences.
Thus, the course features a common basic module followed by the possibility to select one or more in-depth modules regarding either *Marketing and Social Media* or *Design and development*.
Each student may define his/her own course of studies by combining the basic module “digital Basics” with one or two of the in-depth modules “Digital Communication” and “Digital Technologies”.
The Academy may also evaluate, at its discretion, the addition of single academic subjects to the student’s course of studies.
