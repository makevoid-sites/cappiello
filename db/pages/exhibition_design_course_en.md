Every kind of exhibitions, every kind of stand, in general, any exposition event is also the project of architecture, image and design. First of all, any exhibition is the most significant example of three-dimensional communication; macro-messages not only intended for viewing, but also to be able to stand out and attract the visitors.

This course aims to provide the approaches, methods and tools for the design of exhibitions space and to illustrate techniques and materials of construction.
