To foster orientation and help students to decide whether the profession of Interior Designer or Visual Designer is right for them, every month the Academy organises an open day of 4 hours. Attendance at the open day is completely free of charge and involves no obligation to sign on for the courses.

*The open days are the best way to see the Academy for yourself and understand how our teaching methods work.*

The open days are aimed at appraising students interests and aptitudes and also offer elements for evaluating the award of scholarships.
In the course of the day, the teachers illustrate the main subjects of study and organise practical exercises; there is even a lecture by former students now in professional careers.
